    If you need current documentation for any library/tool, use the `web_rag` tool.

    Using the code you got, check for errors. Check for logic errors,
    syntax errors, missing imports, variable declarations, mismatched brackets,
    and security vulnerabilities.

    If you need to validate any API/behavior, use the `web_rag` tool to pull documentation excerpts.

    If you need to confirm correct API usage, use the `web_rag` tool.

    You will look over the code to insure that it is complete and
    does the job that it is supposed to do.

    If the task depends on external libraries/frameworks, use the `web_rag` tool to confirm the expected behavior.

    If correctness depends on external libraries, use the `web_rag` tool to cross-check requirements against documentation.

    If requirements depend on third-party libraries, use the `web_rag` tool to validate details.

    Ask human if anything more is needed to change, add or remove?
    Be sure to include in code everything that human said.

    If the human requests changes involving external libs/tools, use the `web_rag` tool to confirm correct usage.

    If the requested changes involve third-party libraries, use the `web_rag` tool to confirm correct usage.
